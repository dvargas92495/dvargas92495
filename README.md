### Nomad, Engineer, Writer aspiring to become a public citizen of the world.

I'm left my private job in August 2020 so that I could build, learn, and share what I'm working on more publicly. Originally from Long Island, New York, I now travel the world spending a different month in a different city. The goal is for this to inspire a lifestyle where I am more connected to the rest of the world and my perspective is not confined to any one place.

I plan to use the funds to support this lifestyle so that I could build and share as much as my work as publicly as possible. I want engineering openly to become my full time job and never have to work for a private organization ever again. I am eternally grateful for any dollar you could give to help me realize this dream. It will motivate me to make sure I am producing content that is valuable for the communities I'm involved with.

The primary home for my work is my online home at https://davidvargas.me. I am interested in building tools that help empower the following communities:

- Roamcult
- React/npm ecosystem
- Digital Nomads
- Writing

If you are in one of these communities and have ideas on how I could provide more value to you, feel free to reach out to me on Twitter!
